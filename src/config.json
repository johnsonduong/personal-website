This Kaizen consisted of conducting root cause analysis, developing countermeasures, analyzing the results, and Yokoten. My proposal was to re-use a defunct mechanical system on site which had the potential to reduce costs by a forecasted 74% and have a payback period of 6 months. At the end of my term, I had the opportunity to present this study to the senior/general managers."

I brought all of these projects from start to finish alongside my coworkers and technicians. I led the whole design process which consisted of 3D modelling, creating engineering drawings, finite element analysis, preparing bill of materials, machining, programming an Arduino, and assembly. Some other projects/activities that I was involved with include developing a pizza kitchen simulation for Management Sciences students to explore during class labs, providing technical support for student design days, and showcasing our projects at virtual open houses."

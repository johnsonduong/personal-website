This Kaizen consisted of conducting root cause analysis, developing countermeasures, analyzing the results, and Yokoten. My proposal was to re-use a defunct mechanical system on site which had the potential to reduce costs by a forecasted 74% and have a payback period of 6 months. At the end of my term, I had the opportunity to present this study to senior management. Another noteworthy project that I led was migrating a paper based approval process for utility requests into electronic format by developing a virtual portal. I created multiple iterations and trial and error with other departments prior to full deployment. The project was well-received and will save countless man-hours at Toyota.",
